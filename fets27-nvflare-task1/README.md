# FeTS27 Task 1 NVFLARE Challenge

This repository is a simulator-first NVFLARE baseline for FeTS27 Task 1.

Participants are expected to edit exactly two files:

- `participant/aggregator.py`
- `participant/client.py`

Everything else should be treated as organizer-controlled unless you are explicitly maintaining the runtime.

## What This Repo Does

- Runs federated training for the `glioma` cohort with the NVFLARE simulator
- Starts the server from a locked SegResNet baseline checkpoint
- Loads the participant-defined server aggregator
- Applies locked per-site training hyperparameters
- Evaluates the best global checkpoint with the public scorer
- Packages a submission containing only the allowed participant files

## Quick Start

This section reflects the WSL flow that was verified in this workspace.

### 1. Create the conda environment

```bash
conda create -y -n nvflare python=3.10
conda activate nvflare
```

### 2. Install runtime dependencies

Install PyTorch first for your machine. In this WSL setup we used:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

Then install the challenge package:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

You can also run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

### 3. Prepare the baseline assets

This writes the deterministic baseline checkpoint used by the simulator:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli prepare-assets --data-root ./data/toy
```

### 4. Prepare the training-dummy layout

If your FeTS dummy cases are available in WSL at `/mnt/f/Brain/Training-Dummy`, run:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli prepare-training-dummy \
  --source-root /mnt/f/Brain/Training-Dummy \
  --data-root ./data/training_dummy
```

By default this keeps the original NIfTI files in place and writes datalists under `data/training_dummy/glioma/datalist/`.

If you want to physically copy the dataset into this repo layout instead, add:

```bash
--file-mode copy
```

### 5. Run a local experiment

Single-round local run:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli run-local \
  --cohort glioma \
  --data-root ./data/training_dummy \
  --workspace ./workspace/training_dummy \
  --output-dir ./outputs/training_dummy \
  --num-rounds 1 \
  --threads 2 \
  --gpu '[0],[1]'
```

Notes:

- `--gpu '[0],[1]'` maps one simulator client to GPU 0 and the other to GPU 1.
- If you want CPU-only execution, omit `--gpu`.
- NVFLARE may force one thread per GPU group when multi-GPU simulation is used.

### 6. Inspect the results

The local run writes:

- `outputs/training_dummy/local_summary.json`
- `outputs/training_dummy/local_summary.csv`
- `workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/server/simulate_job/app_server/FL_global_model.pt`

TensorBoard logs are written under:

- `workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/server/simulate_job/tb_events`

To watch a run while it is still training:

```bash
tail -f \
  workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/site-1/log.txt \
  workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/site-2/log.txt
```

For a shorter progress-only view:

```bash
grep -E "starting validation|validation complete|starting local training|step [0-9]+/|epoch .*complete|prepared update|sending update|Traceback|ERROR" \
  workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/site-*/log.txt
```

Server-side NVFLARE logs are in:

```bash
tail -f workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/server/log.txt
```

You can also open TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir workspace/training_dummy/fets27_glioma/server/simulate_job/tb_events --port 6006
```

Then open `http://localhost:6006`.

If the console stops at `Waiting for result from peer`, that usually means the server is waiting for each client training script to finish and send its model update. Check the per-site `log.txt` files above for validation, step, loss, and update progress. On multi-GPU runs, each client may log `device=cuda:0` even when `--gpu '[0],[1]'` is used, because each client process sees its assigned GPU as local device `cuda:0`.

## Expected Data Layout

The runtime expects:

```text
<data-root>/
  glioma/
    dataset/
    datalist/
      site-1.json
      site-2.json
      site-All.json
```

Reference datalist examples are provided under `assets/sample_datalists/`.

## Participant Workflow

1. Edit `participant/aggregator.py` and/or `participant/client.py`
2. Validate the submission surface:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli validate-submission
```

3. Run locally:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli run-local \
  --cohort glioma \
  --data-root ./data/training_dummy \
  --workspace ./workspace/training_dummy \
  --output-dir ./outputs/training_dummy
```

4. Package the submission:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli package-submission \
  --output ./submission/fets27_task1_submission.zip
```

## Organizer Workflow

Run the official entrypoint on the hidden data root:

```bash
python -m fets27_challenge.cli run-official \
  --data-root /secure/fets27_hidden \
  --workspace ./workspace \
  --output-dir ./outputs/official
```

The official flow uses the same locked evaluator and score calculation as the public local flow.

## Scoring

- Per cohort: mean validation Dice across participating sites using the best global checkpoint
- Overall public score: the `glioma` validation Dice

The evaluator does not rely on TensorBoard summaries. It reloads the selected checkpoint and recomputes the score.

## Public vs Hidden Evaluation

Local public evaluation and official hidden evaluation use the same code path:

- same participant file surface
- same client training loop
- same locked evaluator
- same score aggregation rule

The only difference is the data root and split files.

## Aggregation Ideas

Reference implementations are available in `src/fets27_challenge/reference_aggregators.py`:

- weighted FedAvg baseline
- coordinate-wise median
- clipped mean

## Client Customization

`participant/client.py` is the NVFLARE client script executed at each site. It
starts as an exact copy of the organizer's client training loop; keep the data
loading, model setup, validation, and local-training sections unchanged, as
they are the official challenge behavior and submissions are reviewed against
them.

You may otherwise customize this file freely:

- Run observation code around the training pipeline: read `input_model`
  (received via `flare.receive()`) and log or record anything you like between
  the fixed validation/training calls.
- Customize what is sent to the server: the `FLModel` passed to `flare.send()`
  carries `params`, `metrics`, and `meta`. The baseline aggregator weights
  updates by `meta["NUM_STEPS_CURRENT_ROUND"]` (falls back to `1.0` if absent),
  so keep or adjust that key consistently with your aggregator.
- Customize what is received from the server: the aggregator may return an
  `FLModel` whose `meta` is delivered back to clients in the next round; read
  it through `input_model.meta` in the next `flare.receive()`.

The aggregator (`participant/aggregator.py`) is fully editable and sees every
client update via `accept_model`, so client-to-server and server-to-client
metadata need no organizer-side support.
